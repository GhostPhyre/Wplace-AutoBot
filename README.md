## How to Install the Extension

Note: This browser extension only works on Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and others that support Manifest V3 extensions.

Before starting, check if you have any userscripts **enabled** in Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey related to WPLACE (e.g., Bluemarble, Skirk Marble, or older versions of this script).  
If you find any, make sure to **disable them**.  [Image](https://i.imgur.com/UtZJs3a.png)
